# Mindfulness in the art of software development

## A holistic approach

May be the one or other of you has already heard from Jon Kabat-Zinn, creator of a
stress reduction programm called [MBSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction) or
[Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh), a [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) monk
heavily elaborating about nonviolent ways of life and truly conscious living.
These two guys, as well as many others, make in their teachings, research and practise use of the contemporary
term of [mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness).
Although this term and the giant world behind it has, at first sight, nothing to do with software development,
it can nevertheless be applied to it, since mindful practices can be exercised on every occasion, day and night,
the whole life long.


## What do we understand by mindfulness?

Depending on the secular, cultural or psycho-analytical view one can have on this topic, slightly various
definitions of mindfulness are given in the literature. However mindful activities can be characterized by
a the following attributes:

- They are truly intentional.
- Their focus is directed to the present moment.
- They do not evaluate or judge anything.


## How can this help throughout our daily dev business?

Since software development consists not only of the pure and isolated act of writing source code itself,
but covers in fact the whole lifecycle of a feature from its planning with stakeholders, refinement until
iterative design and implementing phases, distractions to the involved developers can reach a level,
where focussed work is no longer possible. Open plan offices and incidents which can occur at any time
lead to further interferences and defocusing.
Some mindfulness-based hints can relieve stress even in most demanding situations and help to stay healthy
in our daily business:

- **Do one thing at a time.** If pauses occur for example because Jira slows you done like so often, take a deep
breath and enjoy some seconds of your valuable time just for you and your current thougts.
- **Set up a little break** after each commit. A workday is no monolithical block of software hacking. Give yourself
time for a (good) coffee or relax your eyes while eye-chasing clouds in the sky.
- If in incident turns up, **stay calm**. Ask your colleagues for help, nobody expects that you have to solve
the puzzle on your own!
- Do not switch tasks to often for no reason; and for sure *asap* is most probably no reason at all. Before focusing
on a new task, just retain in the present moment, notice the world around you, **let your thoughts come and go**.
- After a long and intense day, **leave the work at work**. After-work hours are waiting for you!
