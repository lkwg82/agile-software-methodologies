# PDCA

Abbreviation for Plan, Do Check, Act

It's an important tool for complex systems. It helps to experiment with
new approaches that are not clearly hlpeing to solve a certain problem.
By doing this PDCA cycle it's possible to try out things. When they are
successful, you can establish them in your team. If not, just go back to
your previous approach.
