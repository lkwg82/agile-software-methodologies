# PDCA

Abbreviation for Plan, Do Check, Act

It's an important tool for complex systems. It helps to experiment with
new approaches that are not seen as obviously helping to solve a certain problem.
By doing this PDCA cycle, it's possible to try out things iteratively.
When an experiment is successful, you can establish the approach in your
routines. If not, just go back to your previous approach.
