# List of agile software methodologies

**Motivation**

As a software practicioner for several years I am continuously observing 
a lack of knowledge about specific methods and concepts. What I miss 
mostly is knowledge about organisation and communication.

**Goal**

To make a start in order to change that (at least around me) I would 
like to collect methods and concepts here.

**Approach**

1. Collect methods and concepts.
1. Rethink the approach when the number exceeds the count of `~30`.

## Dimensions
Software development in general has more dimensions than just *technology*. 
What I see as important dimensions are:
1. organisation
   
   You are not working alone anymore. You are working in a group of people.
   Questions: How do you organize and structure work?
   
2. communication
   
   As you are not working in a complex world and nobody can always complete work alone, how do we effectively communicate with others?
   
3. learning

   We can be very confident about that we don't know everything. We can further be sure, we need some capability in the future we currently don't have. How do we organize learning?
   
4. technology

   Software development without technology would miss the point. (This is just listed for the sake of completeness.)

When we leave university, we are mostly packed with knowledge around the 4th dimension (technology). But with that alone we will fail in the first reality contact badly. 
We will never know everything. But to know what we don't know and should know is the first step out of unconscious incompetence.
